# dqn_atari
The repository is a learning project; essentially me trying to figure out how Deep Q-learning works. 

It's a re-implementation of the DQN algorithm by DeepMind [1]. I've tried to keep the code simple, so it's easy to understand, and also fast to keep debugging cycles short.

I've learned a lot from the implementations of others. Notably from:

https://github.com/yilundu/DQN-DDQN-on-Space-Invaders

https://github.com/keras-rl/keras-rl

https://github.com/devsisters/DQN-tensorflow

and from the following blogs:
